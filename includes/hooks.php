<?php
/**
 * WordPress action and filter hooks.
 */

// This file should primarily contain hooks whose callback functions
// are located in the main functions.php or in general utility files
// like theme-setup.php or helper-functions.php.

// Hooks for functions that have been moved to specialized files
// (e.g., database-functions.php, debug-functions.php)
// should be moved along with their functions or removed from here
// if they are co-located with their functions in the new files.

// Example:
// add_action('after_setup_theme', 'mobooking_init', 5); // If mobooking_init is still in functions.php

// Theme Initialization hook for mobooking_init is now co-located with the function in theme-setup.php.
